## Exploratory Data Analysis

### Air pollution

Datasets on the air pollutants across Nepal is currently available for the past few years. I use one year's data to do some example analysis for now.

I chose the Khumaltar station not for any particular reason, I could have easily chosen Ratnapark or some other station. Analysis do not depend on any station and can be done for any of the other stations.
